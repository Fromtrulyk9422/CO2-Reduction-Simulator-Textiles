# CO2-Reduction-Simulator
A Python-based simulator for analyzing CO‚ÇÇ reduction in different industries.

üìä Dataset: textile_data.csv
This dataset contains hypothetical data (as real and reliable data is difficult to find and diverge between sources) for different materials used in the textile industry, focusing on three key parameters that contribute to environmental sustainability:

CO‚ÇÇ Emissions (kg CO‚ÇÇ per kg material):
The amount of CO‚ÇÇ emissions generated in the production of each material.

Water Usage (L per kg material):
The amount of water required to produce 1 kg of each material.

Recyclability (%):
The percentage of the material that can be recycled after use.

üßµ Textile Materials in the Dataset:
Material	CO‚ÇÇ Emissions (kg CO‚ÇÇ/kg material)	Water Usage (L/kg material)	Recyclability (%)
Cotton	15 kg CO‚ÇÇ	10,000 L	30%
Polyester	6 kg CO‚ÇÇ	50 L	80%
Wool	20 kg CO‚ÇÇ	15,000 L	50%
Nylon	10 kg CO‚ÇÇ	200 L	70%
Linen	8 kg CO‚ÇÇ	500 L	90%
üè≠ Purpose:
This dataset serves as an input for analyzing CO‚ÇÇ reduction strategies in the textile industry. By comparing different fabrics, the simulation will help identify which materials have the least environmental impact and provide suggestions for reducing overall CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
